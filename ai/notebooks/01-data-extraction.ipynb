Zhang, S. Mumtaz, and J. Rodriguez, \"Social Big- Data-Based Content Dissemination on the Internet of Vehicles,\" in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 2018 (160 Citations)  This is a groundbreaking contribution to IoV. For the first time, Shahid showed how to combine the physical and social layer information to realize rapid content dissemination in D2D-V2V-based IoV networks. Previously, it was considered one of the most challenging challenges in intelligent transportation. Real-world social big data was collected from the most significant Chinese microblogging service Sina Weibo and the largest Chinese video - sharing site Youku to test the solutions. o (Second impacted work) Z.

Rodriguez, \"Computation Resource Allocation and Task Assignment Optimization in Vehicular Fog Computing: A Contract-Matching Approach,\" in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 2019 (152 Citations)  Shahid coined the term Vehicular fog computing (VFC) in this seminal work. He also received the best Journal award from IEEE TCGN and the best IEEE conference paper award from IEEE 15th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCM). The main challenge was how to offload the computation tasks from the base station to vehicular fog nodes by leveraging the under-utilized computation resources of nearby vehicles. Shahid addressed this challenge and provided a solution to minimize the network delay from a contract-matching integration perspective.  (Third impacted work) Z. Zhou, H. Yu, C. Xu, Y. Zhang, S. Mumtaz, and J. Rodriguez, \"Dependable Content Distribution in D2D-Based Cooperative Vehicular Networks: A Big Data-Integrated Coalition Game Approach,\" in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2018 ( 140 Citations)  This paper, the first of its kind, proposes a D2D framework for vehicular networks, and it is part of 3GPP Release 14 (36.746). Shahid investigated how to achieve dependable content distribution in device-to-device (D2D)-based cooperative vehicular networks by combining big data-based vehicle trajectory prediction with coalition formation game-based resource allocation. Shahid's proposed algorithm was tested based on a real-world map and realistic vehicular traffic using the Huawei Base station in China. This framework is a springboard for future research on cooperative Vehicular Networks as Huawei. Other Impacted work on Data Sciences o Z.

His research and services are considered an essential and fundamental reference, significantly impacting green communication in the academic sector and industry. As a result, IEEE has started a new track and society called \"Green Communications & Computing society\" in the academic sector. Currently, around 2K are members of the IEEE green community, among operators and industry, and all IEEE conferences have a Green Communication track due to his work on this subject.  Moreover, IEEE ComSoc also granted him a distinguished lecture for his impacted work on green communication. Out of his 80 transactions, Dr Mumtaz has published more than 15 transactions on this topic, organized workshops, and delivered tutorials in green communication at major IEEE conferences. In addition, in the industry sector, he contributed to the 3GPP release 12/13 on the sleep mode of the base station. o Dr. Mumtaz's contribution to Green communication is his thorough and rigorous approach in developing algorithms and protocols, which lead to today's energy-efficient wireless communication. He was one of the first researchers to propose the Green Communication concept. Before his work, most studies only considered the system's spectral efficiency to optimize system performance and completely ignored energy efficiency. His idea leads to one of European's pioneer projects in the field of Green Communication (https://cordis.europa.eu/ project/id/248577). Afterward, IEEE started a new society and track in major IEEE conferences on Green communication, i.e., ICC and Globecom on \"IEEE ComSoc Green Communications & Computing society.\" Currently, he is leading the Green communication society as Vice-chair. Since 3G, increasing energy efficiency and decreasing energy per bit of the wireless system is one of the priority areas for mobile operators'. The primary source of wireless communication energy comes from the active element (baseband) and passive (RF) components of base stations/mobile devices. Thanks to Dr. Mumtaz's contribution, novel solutions and algorithms are currently helping commercially deployed base station/mobile devices to improve their system's energy efficiency and decrease energy per bit.  First Impacted Work: Shahid Mumtaz & Jonathan Rodriguez \"Green Communication for 4G Wireless Systems\", River Publisher, March 2013 (Download, 530 copies)-  Second Impacted Work: K.
